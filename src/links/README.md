# Link helper

This alleviates some limitations React-router has.

It allows to use the same component for internal and external links. With the default react-router setup we need to choose and style <Link> vs <a> manually.

It somewhat makes the current links unclickable. It still renders an `<a>` underneath as a limitation for this small project.
